## MakersBnB
MakersBnB is web based app, which allows any user to create an account, view a list of spaces and add a new space. 

This is our first team project as part of Makers Academy (contributors are listed below).

**Thought Process**
----
We're transferring our knowledge of Ruby applications into Javascript.

Our controller is created using JS, Node & Express.
Our test environment will be in Jasmine. 

**Installation Instructions**
----
To install this repo on your local computer run the following commands in the terminal:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Dhara-95/Makersbnb.git
$ cd Makersbnb
$ npm install
```

To run the server:

```
node app.js
```

To view the web application, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (ensure the server is run before navigating to this web address).

**Run Tests**
----
To run the tests, open the SpecRunner.html file by running the following command in the terminal:

```
$ open ./SpecRunner.html
``` 

**Database**
----
The database is located on ElephantSQL, a cloud server. We have accessed this on our local machines through Postico & TablePlus, and linked them to our code in our sql.js file.

To view the current contents of the database, run:
```
node sql.js
```

**Follow up**
----

- We would have liked to finish user stories 7 and 8 

- Currently the request button redirects to the homepage - ideally this would send a form to owner of the space to approve/reject. 

- Currently the site doesn't allow the owner to add dates to a space, we would have liked to add this functionality 

- We would have liked to add more tests (both unit and feature tests)

- We can currently add a new space and view it, but we cannot update or delete (CRUD pattern)

- We can currently add a new user and login, however cannot update or delete (CRUD pattern)
